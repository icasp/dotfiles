exclude dotfiles path from rsync
can execute from anywhere (will copy to ~/.dotfiles)
.dotfiles auto synced to $BACKUP for restore readyness
runtime copies
system-setup


# General
* Parallelize more work (data transfer, brews) : need to reduce waiting time
* Differ big transfers?
* shares options
* mounts
* Mention clearly not automatically restored folders
* Energy Prefs
* Dock icons (at least remove following :
LaunchPad
System Prefs
iBooks
iTunes
Facetime
Maps
Reminders
Notes
Contacts
)
* UI reboot at end
* softwareupdate -i -a
* Verbosity / readbility of the whole process
* Network configuration
* Move runtime and others edits / all conf? to $BACKUP (cleaner in the end?) <- requires better operation way awareness
( $0 |  sed last / to last .)

# Missing / check?
* Dock zoom + size
* TimeMachine icon in bar
* Activity mon CPU icon in dock
* "All my files" finder
* Hide all from Desktop
* Spotlight prefs

# Cleanup
* USER / ME $?

# Finish DOC
